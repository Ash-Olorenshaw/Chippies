# Chippies

A really basic, really simple runner written in Python.

Wholly unfeatureful and mostly written for my own use - it does work pretty well!

## Usage

Make sure you have Python3
```nu-script
# Fedora (should be installed by default)
sudo dnf install python3

# MacOS
brew install python
```

It's Python, you can't get much simpler...

```nu-script
# clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/Ash-Olorenshaw/Chippies.git

# run
cd Chippies
python ./main.py
```
